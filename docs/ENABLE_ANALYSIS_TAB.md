# How to Re-enable Sec360 Analysis Tab

The Sec360 Analysis tab has been disabled to simplify the UI since you're not using it currently. The tab code is preserved with safety checks.

## To Re-enable Later:

1. Open `sec360.py`
2. Find lines 283-286
3. Uncomment the lines:
   ```python
   # Change this:
   # self.analysis_frame = ttk.Frame(self.notebook)
   # self.notebook.add(self.analysis_frame, text="🔍 Sec360 Analysis")
   # self.setup_analysis_tab()
   
   # To this:
   self.analysis_frame = ttk.Frame(self.notebook)
   self.notebook.add(self.analysis_frame, text="🔍 Sec360 Analysis")
   self.setup_analysis_tab()
   ```

## What the Analysis Tab Does:
- Provides direct code analysis with Ollama
- Shows analysis results in a dedicated tab
- Exports analysis data
- Maintains analysis history

## Current Active Tabs:
- 🎯 Practice Session (Practice with AI Security Mentor)
- 📚 Sample Code (Sample code files for practice)
- 📋 Session Logs (View practice session logs)
- 📊 Statistics (View session statistics)
- 🔄 Active Sessions (Manage active sessions)
- 🖥️ System Status (System and Ollama status)

The analysis functionality is still available in the Practice Session tab when you send code messages.
